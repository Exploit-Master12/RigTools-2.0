# RigTools-2.0
**Rigtools** is an exploit that allows users to run code on extensions, disable extensions, and basically do whatever they want with an extension as long as it has the correct permissions. As of October 2024, it is **patched** in Chrome OS 128 and above. **NOT ANYMORE NOW THAT I FOUND AND MADE A NEW VERSION**
