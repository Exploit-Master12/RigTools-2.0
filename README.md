# RigTools-2.0  **THIS ONLY WORKS FOR CHROMEBOOK,NO WINDOWS OR ANYTHING***
**Rigtools** is an exploit that allows users to run code on extensions, disable extensions, and basically do whatever they want with an extension as long as it has the correct permissions. As of October 2024, it is **patched** in Chrome OS 128 and above. **NOT ANYMORE NOW THAT I FOUND AND MADE A NEW VERSION**

### How do you use it?

1. Open this link and just leave it alone. (Note: This will not run code it's just there to fix the second page.)
```md
devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html
```
2. Open this link and go to Network.

```md
devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html?experiments=true&ws=rig.kxtz.dev/
```
3. Double-Click the black/grey box:

4.Wait for a bit...It should open a page that has a lot of red and purple buttons.

5. Click on the button named "Gforms Locked mode".

6.Behold:RIGTOOLS!!! You can disable extensions that you want. (A reminder,These may stop working after a few weeks,you might have to do it again.)

7. Finally,you can run code like "Hello World" or something like that through the extensions.

8.Go to 
```md
https://devtoolbypass.playcode.io/
```
And now you can do whatever you want on your computer.Use this wisely,and stay on task in class.At lunch,you could be hangin' out in the library with your friends playing bloxd.io or whatever... =-D
